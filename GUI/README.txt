README
----------------------------
This is made from both mine (Patricks) and Daniels list of requirements from the slides
and notes from our customer meeting. Look over them and add/change/delete anything you see fit. 
Each one of these requirments will need to be place on our SRS docment in a grid like the one
on page 6 already. If we each take a few, it shouldn't be too much work. I have already added 
Layout1 - Layout5 as a example. 
Remember that this list will change throughout the project. 
According to the instructions, I believe we only have to have
ten, but the more concrate requirments we have now, the easier it'll be later. 

I put a ? next to a few of them, I'm not sure if these specific ones need to be in the SRS because 
they don't really follow the good requirments guidelines in the lecture slides; or these requirements
need to be fleshed out further. Some of these may be able to go under section three Non-Functional 
Requirements in the SRS. 
 
I numbered them all with their category and then just numbering them. We can use these numbers in 
the SRS, unless anyone else can think of a better system, in which case, feel free to edit
