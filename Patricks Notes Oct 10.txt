* Hey guys, I just typed out some notes from our customer meeting today
* (Mostly just to make sure I know how to commit something to github)

Notes from our customer meeting on Oct 10 : 

- Output should display total time it would take. Could determine this from the total lenght and a static speed. 
-- Does not need to take into account the amount of time you stay at each location 

- Should be able to input a starting time for the trip

- Should be a standalone application, not web based. 

- Should have some sort of user authentication
-- Each user account should store previous searches and previously visited locations

- Display output on google earth, no specific requirements for how it is displayed in the application

- Should be able to Add/Mod/Del locations

- Should be compatible with google earth api 

- Locations should be stored as "state" -> "City" -> "Place"
-- States should include MD, DC, and pennsylvania (Also note, we need to get a specific list of places from customer)

- We need to create company name, logo, motto, gui mockup and give to customer.
