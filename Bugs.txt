Things that need to be tested:
*window flow
*user authentication
*add/edit/remove current/prev searchs
*promo/demoteuser
*Ensure all location in database are correct. (There's a few that aren't in the US)
*Ensure there are over 100 locations in database (I think now we only have ~80) Also, ensure all locations are unique.
*Ensure all fields of previous searches are stored correctly.


Fixed :
* Ensure nothing is being printed to the screen, warnings should be shown in message boxes.
* Should display an "account successfully created" message when making a new account
* Searches are not marked as non optimal when they're changed.
* When admins change user attributes, warning message "file already exists"
* No validation on Mod User screen from admin panel.
* Switch to admin/user screens - should say the name of the user that's currently logged in.
* Max Length of user names - 25 chars
* KML creater displays time incorrect around 12 noon. Ex : displays 0:30 instead of 12:30. Slight issues with mins not display correctly as well.
* Renaming a user clears their previous searches.
Note : Just removed the admin's ability to rename users.
* Erros when running a trip from the admin account.
* No way to log out
Note : Clicking x on main gui or admin gui now asks if you want to exit or just log out,.
* Cant save an edited prev search / After selecting a previous search from dropdown, dropdown defaults back to only having the "Custom Search" option.
* When searching for a new location to add, title of dialog is "Select an Option"; should be something better. Also, that message should be cleaner.
