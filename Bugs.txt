Known Bugs:
* Cant save an edited prev search / After selecting a previous search from dropdown, dropdown defaults back to only having the "Custom Search" option. 
Note : I changed a ton of code around here, maybe fixing these problems, but I have no fully tested it. Pat, Dec 4
* Prints errors randomly (???)
* Guis have empty methods and TODO stubs
* UImanager not finished
* No way to log out 
* When searching for a new location to add, title of dialog is "Select an Option"; should be something better. Also, that message should be cleaner. 
* Speed of trip attribute should be displayed somewhere


Things that need to be tested:
*window flow
*user authentication
*add/edit/remove current/prev searchs
*promo/demoteuser
*Ensure all location in database are correct. (There's a few that aren't in the US)
*Ensure there are over 100 locations in database (I think now we only have ~80) Also, ensure all locations are unique. 
*Ensure all fields of previous searches are stored correctly. 


Fixed : 
* Ensure nothing is being printed to the screen, warnings should be shown in message boxes.  (Patrick - Dec 3)
* Should display an "account successfully created" message when making a new account (Patrick - Dec 3)
* Searches are not marked as non optimal when they're changed. (Patrick - Dec 3)
* When admins change user attributes, warning message "file already exists" (Pat - Dec 4)
* No validation on Mod User screen from admin panel. (Pat - Dec 4)
* Switch to admin/user screens - should say the name of the user that's currently logged in. (Pat - Dec 4)
* Max Length of user names - 25 chars 
* KML creater displays time incorrect around 12 noon. Ex : displays 0:30 instead of 12:30. Slight issues with mins not display correctly as well. (Pat Dec 4)
* Renaming a user clears their previous searches. (Pat Dec 4)
Note : Just removed the admin's ability to rename users.
