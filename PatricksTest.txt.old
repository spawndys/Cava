- We need to create company name, logo, motto, gui mockup and give to customer. 
1)  Provides the user with the ability to select several (>20) from numerous sites with lat/long locations (>100) through a GUI.

2)  The user will identify the stop and start sites .

3)  The locations should be fairly far apart (not so much bars in Baltimore, but capitals of US, US national parks, places on your bucket list, largest cities in the world, etc.).

3)  The system will solve for the shorted straight line distance to visit all the site s.

4)  The sites and information about the site will be displayed on Google Earth.7

5)  The project should provide help files for users and administrators.

6)  Administrators have the ability to add, remove, and edit sites.

7)  Users and Administrators have usernames and passwords. 


README
----------------------------
This is made from both mine (Patricks) and Daniels list of requirements from the slides
and notes from our customer meeting. Look over them and add/change/delete anything you see fit. 
Each one of these requirments will need to be place on our SRS docment in a grid like the one
on page 6 already. If we each take a few, it shouldn't be too much work. Remember that this list
will change throughout the project. According to the instructions, I believe we only have to have
ten, but the more concrate requirments we have now, the easier it'll be later. 

I put a ? next to a few of them, I'm not sure if these specific ones need to be in the SRS because 
they don't really follow the good requirments guidelines in the lecture slides; or these requirements
need to be fleshed out further.
